# Rust Events team

This is the repository for all planning of the Rust event team. We give hints, help and contacts for running events.

Feel free to have a look at our [open issues](https://github.com/rust-community/events/issues).

If you want to contact us, please send an email to [community@rust-lang.org](mailto:community@rust-lang.org).
